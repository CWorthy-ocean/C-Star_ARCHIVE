function [elem,coef,nnel] = get_tri_coef(lonp,latp,lonc,latc,maskp)

%
% Inputs:
%          parent lon and lat 2d arrays (lonp, latp)
%          child lon and lat 2d arrays (lonc, latc)
%
% Ouputs:
%          elem - pointers to 2d gridded data (at lonp,latp locations) from
%                 which the interpolation is computed (3 for each child point)
%          coef - linear interpolation coefficients
%          nnel - 2d pointer to the nearest neighbor in the horizontal
%
%  Use:
%          To subsequently interpolate data from Fp(lonp,latp) to Fc(lonc,latc), the following
%          will work:      Fc  = sum(coef.*Fp(elem),3);  This line  should come in place of all
%          griddata calls. Since it avoids repeated triangulations and tsearches (that are done
%          with every call to griddata) it should be much faster.
